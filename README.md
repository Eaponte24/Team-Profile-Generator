# Team-Profile-Generator


## Description

With this appilication, ive come up with a quick and easy solution to keep track of all of your teammates on your development team. Using this youll easily be able to add who is on your team, their emails, githubs and office numbers depending on their roles! They are cleanly organized on a html page that is created once you have answered the questions in the terminal.

## Usage

To start this application call you need to do is run a node start in the terminal and you will be prompted with questions pertaining to your role first. Once you have answered your questions then you will be asked if you want to add another member, if you choose to then you can add more and more team members and their roles. Once you choose to "create team" a HTML page will be generated for you along with a CSS sheet that is already in the dist folder.

## Features

Some features that I've included in this application are that all links are useable and will bring you to the corresponding links. Also when a new team member is created they will have their own card on the page so they are neatly organized. Along with this, ive added the needed tests for all of my functions to run properly and for continued development on the project.
